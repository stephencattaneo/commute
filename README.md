commute
=======
Intended to be a quick application for use on an iphone to tell me about available commute trains.

The application uses static transit route information for now.

TODO:
  1. take advantage of BART APIs
    a. travel advisory
    b. route times
  2. fix bug around bart trip that is too late for a VTA
